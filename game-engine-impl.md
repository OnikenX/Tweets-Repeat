# Twitter API acess

The **twitter api needs an user to login** to its twitter user account, and give an pin back, **that work needs to be done in the client(game) side**, I can try to implement it in the server side given the user and password, **but it is probably against the twitter's TOS**. 


## Implementation

### Server side

The server is the app, it will ask for the user pin and so it will log him in in the app.

### Client side

The client must receive the messange deencrypt it to send to the game engine.
